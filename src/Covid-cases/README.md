# Covid-cases

What better job for your falcon badge than to show the total number of cases in the country? The badge updates count every 10mins based on statistics from https://www.mohfw.gov.in/

Don't forget to add your Wi-Fi credentials in Covid-cases.ino

You will probably have to hunt the interwebs for the libraries used though.
